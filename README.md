## 📌 Project Overview  
The Aadhaar ecosystem generates **massive volumes of enrolment and update data every day**, but much of this data remains underutilized for proactive decision making.

This project presents a **UIDAI Aadhaar Decision Intelligence System** that transforms raw Aadhaar enrolment and update records into **actionable insights** to support:

✅ proactive planning  
✅ better resource allocation  
✅ early anomaly detection  
✅ demand surge preparedness  

💡 **Goal:** Shift Aadhaar operations from **reactive service delivery** to **predictive, data-driven governance**.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives  
- Understand enrolment and update patterns using **EDA**
- Detect irregular behaviour using **anomaly detection**
- Build forecasting models to predict future enrolment demand
- Create early-warning indicators like rolling signals and surge scoring

---

## ✨ Features Implemented  

### 📊 1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
We performed detailed EDA to identify:
- Enrolment and update trends over time  
- State-wise and demographic insights  
- Seasonal behaviour and growth fluctuations  
- Regions with consistently high / low activity  

---

### 🚨 2 Anomaly Detection  
To strengthen system integrity and identify irregular demand patterns, we flagged:
- sudden spikes in enrolments  
- unexpected drops that may indicate access issues  
- unusual variations requiring attention  

---

### 📈 3 Early Warning Indicators  
Instead of only plotting graphs, we introduced decision signals such as:
- **Rolling Demand Signals** → to track demand movement smoothly  
- **Volatility-based Surge Risk Score** → to quantify surge probability  

These indicators help improve preparedness and optimize planning.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Forecasting  
We went one step ahead by building **two ML models** and selecting the best one:

### ✅ Models Built  
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

📌 After comparing performance, we selected:  
🏆 **Random Forest Regressor** as the final forecasting model.

### 📈 What forecasting helps with  
- predicting upcoming enrolment demand  
- anticipating demand surges early  
- supporting better staffing and operational planning
